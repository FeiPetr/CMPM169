			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>In my previous project, I had incorporated music in the background. In this new experiment, I kept that music in, then uploaded an image of my art into p5js. I decided I wanted to play around with image manipulation, and settled on messing around with pixelation.

					I found a pixel painter example online by happycoding.io and integrated their code into mine (making some slight changes) to make sure it would work with my image and existing code.
					</p>
				<p>This code works by taking random coordinates, picking up the color there, and putting down a pixel of that color. It does this continuously. I decided I wanted to try and make something with more precise pixelation, and with user input. This way, I could also incorporate sound into the user input.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I had some trouble getting the image to pixelate. I essentially took an array containing all the pixels in the original image. Using them, I create blocks the size of however large I set the new pixel size to be. Then I found the average color of each block and displayed it.</p>
				<p>At this point I hadn’t figured out how to incorporate sound into it yet, so I decided to add functionality to adjust the background music. Luckily, p5.js turned out to have a custom setVolume function.
				</p>
				<p>I was also surprised at how easy it was to add a slider.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>From here on, I wanted to connect the pixelation and the sound. I decided to make the slider correlate with both the sound and the pixelation.
				</p>
				<p>I ran into a few issues off the bat. For one, the page kept freezing when I slid the slider. I realized this was for two reasons: the lowest setting being 0, therefore making the pixelate algorithm fail to calculate, and the pixelate function being called in draw, meaning it was constantly being callen. I set the default to 0.1 and made the pixelate only be called when the slider was modified.
				</p>
				<p>The other major issue was that I realized that instead of pixelating based off the image, it would pixelate based off the canvas. This meant that with enough tries, the image would become watered down and blurred.
				</p>
				<p>After a lot of troubleshooting, I was unable to fix this. My first thought was to add a creepy image when the image got blurred to a certain point, but I consistently ran into CORS restrictions when trying to load a new image. In the end, I settled for blackening the screen and adding the word “jumpscare” and playing creepy music when the image got blurred enough.
				</p>
				<p>At this point I considered my project a finished product</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think I did a good job overall in terms of effort put in, but I probably could have been more creative and experimental when it came to mixing sound and images. I spent a lot of time getting the pixelation to work and troubleshooting image uploads. It taught me a lot and I tried my best to circumvent my problems in a funny or creative way (for example, adding the jumpscare when I realized my image would continuously degrade). This also gave me an opportunity to play a different soundtrack, thereby incorporating sound even more.
				</p>
				<p>I got really into working on this and was extremely determined to finish it on the same day I started. I may have done better if I took a break to work on it a day later, but I began fixating very hard. In the future, I might be better at creative and technical aspects if I took breaks and came back to the code later, especially since I had time before the due date.
